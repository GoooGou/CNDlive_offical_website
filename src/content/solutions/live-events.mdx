## The Challenge: Going Live from Anywhere

In live sports, concerts, and outdoor events, there are no second chances. The biggest challenge isn't the camera gear—it's the **connectivity**. Traditional venues often have congested WiFi or non-existent Ethernet, and satellite trucks are prohibitively expensive.

<Callout type="warning" title="The Network Bottleneck">
  Relying on a single network connection at a crowded stadium is a recipe for disaster. Packet loss and jitter can ruin the viewer experience instantly.
</Callout>

## The Solution: 5G Bonding & SRT

We replace heavy OB Vans with a backpack. By aggregating multiple network connections (4G/5G, WiFi, Ethernet), CNDLive encoders create a single, robust pipeline for your video.

### How Portable Bonding Works

<Steps>

### 1. Signal Acquisition
Connect your camera directly to our portable encoder (like the **P-Series**) via SDI or HDMI.

### 2. Network Aggregation (Bonding)
The encoder splits the video data across multiple SIM cards and local networks simultaneously. If one carrier drops, the others pick up the slack instantly.

### 3. Reliable Transport
We use **SRT (Secure Reliable Transport)** protocol to recover lost packets over the public internet, ensuring a glitch-free feed even on jittery connections.

### 4. Cloud / Studio Production
The bonded signal lands in your studio or cloud production mixer (vMix, TriCaster) for graphics, replays, and distribution.

## Why Switch to IP Bonding?

Compare the modern IP workflow against traditional satellite transmission.

<ProsCons>
  <div slot="pros">
    - **Cost Efficiency**: Fraction of the cost of satellite time.
    - **Mobility**: Cameramen can roam freely without long cables.
    - **Low Latency**: Glass-to-glass latency as low as 500ms.
  </div>
  <div slot="cons">
    - **Legacy Systems**: Traditional Satellite Uplink is heavy and expensive.
    - **Setup Time**: Satellite dishes require hours to align; Bonding takes seconds.
  </div>
</ProsCons>
