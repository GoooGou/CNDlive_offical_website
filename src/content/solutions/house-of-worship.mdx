## Extending the Reach

In the modern era, the church is no longer defined by four walls. Whether reaching congregants at home or connecting multiple satellite campuses, live streaming has become a ministry essential.

However, most technical teams are run by **volunteers**. Complex broadcast gear can be overwhelming.

<Callout type="info" title="The Volunteer Advantage">
  CNDLive solutions are designed for **Simplicity**. With NDI technology, one Ethernet cable handles Video, Audio, Power (PoE), and Control (PTZ), making setup a breeze for volunteers.

## Workflow: From Sanctuary to the World

How to set up a professional worship stream without the headache.

<Steps>

### 1. PTZ Camera Setup
Install NDI-enabled PTZ cameras. Connect them to your local network switch via a single CAT6 cable. No HDMI/SDI spaghetti mess.

### 2. Production (vMix / OBS)
All camera feeds appear instantly on your computer running vMix or OBS. Volunteers can switch scenes easily via a tablet or Stream Deck.

### 3. Encoding & Distribution
Send the program feed to a CNDLive Hardware Encoder. This dedicated device ensures your stream goes to **YouTube and Facebook simultaneously** without burdening your PC.

### 4. Multi-Site Delivery
For satellite campuses, the encoder sends a high-quality, low-latency **SRT feed** point-to-point, ensuring the sermon is synced across all locations.

</Steps>
