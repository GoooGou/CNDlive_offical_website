The pandemic has ended, yet its lessons linger. During those days, live streaming reshaped how we experience church. In-person worship has returned, but congregants still expect online options and interactive digital outreach.

**Why stream your services?**

- Serve homebound or traveling members
- Strengthen daily connection with your flock
- Offer real-time prayer and support anywhere
- Extend your ministry’s reach to seekers worldwide

**Getting started**  
You’ll need a camera, computer, and a reliable streaming encoder. Beginners can go live instantly on Facebook or YouTube; for higher stability and quality, pair your encoder with a bonding solution that combines multiple networks.
