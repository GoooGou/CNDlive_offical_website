The annual Christmas Concert is a highlight of the year, and the client wished to stream the event live so that everyone could join in the festive cheer. To ensure a successful live stream, stable internet service is crucial. However, challenges arose due to the lack of wired internet on-site and the expectation of a crowded venue. Let’s explore how we addressed these issues.

The event was held in Taipei’s largest convention center, featuring an auditorium with a capacity of 3,300 people. This year's Christmas music concert attracted approximately 2,500 attendees.

#### Solution Overview

To meet the client’s requirements for a stable live stream, we deployed the **CNDLive X1 4G bonding encoder**, equipped with three SIM cards from different telecommunications providers. This setup ensures robust connectivity even in densely populated areas where network congestion is common. For monitoring purposes, we also installed a router with a 4G dongle to check the status via NDI Monitor.

To streamline operations and enable remote management of the X1 device, we integrated the **CNDLive Manager Max** hardware to create a comprehensive solution. With Max, the client doesn’t need to deploy a complex bonding server; only a fixed IP address and port forwarding are required for setup. This allowed us to monitor network conditions and remotely initiate the YouTube streaming service, ensuring smooth and efficient management.

#### Performance

During the operation, the X1 displayed relevant data on its screen, confirming a stable transmission rate of **10 Mbps**. The Manager Max GUI provided real-time visibility into the bonding status of each network, showing that the X1 maintained a consistent 10 Mbps bandwidth throughout the event.

Whether you’re streaming from a bustling convention center or any other challenging environment, the **X1 + Manager Max** combination ensures reliable and smooth live streaming.
