> **vMix** is a powerful, flexible and easy-to-use real-time video production software that covers almost every live-production need: concerts, school events, sports, worship services, esports, webinars and more.  
> It is also **budget-unfriendly** for small teams:
>
> - HD: $350
> - 4K: $700
> - Pro: $1,200  
>   When you need **multi-platform or multiview streams**, the bill multiplies.

That’s why we pair **vMix** with the **C6 hardware encoder**—a cost-effective way to send **different pictures to different platforms** without extra vMix licenses.

## Real-World Case 1

**Taiwan Tech Summit 2024**

- **Public**: President’s keynote → Facebook Live
- **Private**: Internal awards → YouTube Live
- **Problem**: Facebook stream must end with an outro slide; YouTube continues.
- **Solution**:
  1. vMix 27 (4 external outputs + trigger macro)
  2. C6 encoder fed with **two distinct program mixes**
  3. Facebook output stops automatically after outro; YouTube output keeps running.
- **Result**: One operator, one vMix license, two independent streams, zero downtime.

## Real-World Case 2

**Multi-view Concert Stream**

- **Requirement**: Same performance, but viewers choose between **stage-cam**, **drone-cam**, or **crowd-cam**.
- **Solution**:
  1. vMix 27 sends three **external outputs** (each a different multiview).
  2. Each output hits a **dedicated C6**.
  3. Three separate RTMP endpoints give the audience **interactive camera angles**—no extra PCs, no extra vMix licenses.

## Key Take-away

Use **vMix for mixing**, **C6 for multiplying**.  
You get **unlimited platforms & views** while keeping software costs **locked to a single license**.
