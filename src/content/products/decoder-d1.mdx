## Overview

The **D1 4K IP Video Decoder** is a professional hardware decoding device designed for broadcast, surveillance, and AV-over-IP applications. It receives IP video streams from various sources and decodes them into high-quality **HDMI (up to 4K)** and **3G-SDI** signals.

### Key Features

* **Advanced Decoding Engine**: Supports both **H.265 (HEVC)** and **H.264 (AVC)** compression, delivering superior image quality with lower bandwidth consumption.
* **Dual Interface Output**: Simultaneously output via HDMI 2.0 and 3G-SDI, making it versatile for both local monitoring and professional broadcast workflows.
* **Broad Protocol Support**: Fully compatible with SRT, RTMP, RTSP, UDP, and HLS, ensuring seamless integration with major streaming platforms and encoders.
* **Multi-Channel Decoding**: Capable of decoding a single 4K stream or up to 4 channels of 1080p video simultaneously for split-screen display.
* **24/7 Reliability**: Industrial-grade design with low power consumption and PoE support for easy deployment.


*Dual Gigabit Ethernet ports and HDMI/SDI outputs.*
