For over a decade, RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) has been the king of live streaming. However, as remote production demands higher reliability over the public internet, **SRT (Secure Reliable Transport)** is taking the throne.

## The Problem with RTMP

RTMP relies on TCP, which can cause buffering loops when packet loss occurs. It wasn't designed for the modern, fluctuating conditions of cellular (4G/5G) or congested public networks.

## Why SRT Wins

* **Packet Loss Recovery**: SRT uses advanced retransmission techniques to recover lost video packets without adding significant latency.
* **Security**: Built-in AES-128/256 encryption keeps your feed safe.
* **Firewall Traversal**: SRT's caller/listener modes make it easier to navigate complex corporate firewalls.

At CNDLive, we recommend using SRT for point-to-point contribution (e.g., Camera to Studio) and RTMP for final distribution (e.g., Studio to YouTube).
