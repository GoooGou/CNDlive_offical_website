## The Shift to IP Video

The transition from SDI to IP-based workflows is no longer a trend; it's the standard. With the release of the **C6 Encoder**, we are pushing the boundaries of what's possible over a standard 1GbE network.

> NDI 6 is the biggest leap forward in IP video technology since the protocol was introduced. It brings HDR and WAN connectivity to the masses.

## 1. Network Architecture

Before plugging in any cameras, we need to talk about the backbone: **The Network Switch**.

{/* 2. 测试 Callout 组件 */}

<Callout type="warning" title="C6 Encoder Review - 4K NDI Workflow">
  For 4K60 setups, do **not** use unmanaged switches. We highly recommend a
  switch with **PoE+ (802.3at)** and full Layer 3 management capabilities to
  handle multicast traffic efficiently.

<Steps>

### Access the Web UI

Connect your laptop to the same network. Open your browser and navigate to the encoder's default IP address (usually printed on the sticker).

### Input Selection

Navigate to the **Video Input** tab. Select either HDMI 2.0 or 12G-SDI depending on your camera source. Ensure the resolution matches your camera output.

### Encoding Profile

Set the encoding profile to **NDI HX3**. This offers the best balance between quality (visually lossless) and bandwidth (~80Mbps for 4K).

</Steps>

## 4. Firmware & Resources

To get the best performance, please ensure your device is running the latest firmware `v2.4.0`.

<Callout type="info" title="Update Note">
  The device will reboot automatically after the update. Do not power off during
  the process.

## 5. SRT vs. NDI: Which one to choose?

Many users ask us whether they should use SRT or NDI for remote production. Here is a quick breakdown.

{/* 7. 测试 ProsCons 组件 */}

<ProsCons>
  <div slot="pros">
    - **Ultra Low Latency**: Less than 1 frame on local networks. - **Auto
    Discovery**: No need to type IP addresses manually. - **Alpha Channel**:
    Native support for transparent video (perfect for graphics).
  </div>
  <div slot="cons">
    - **High Bandwidth**: Requires stable, high-speed local network. - **No
    Retransmission**: Unlike SRT, standard NDI does not handle packet loss well
    over the public internet.
  </div>
</ProsCons>
