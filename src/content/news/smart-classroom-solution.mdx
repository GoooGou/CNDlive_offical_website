## The Challenge

A leading university needed to upgrade 50 lecture halls to support "HyFlex" learning. The requirements were strict:
* Support for 4K presentations.
* Integration with Zoom and Teams.
* Automated recording scheduling.

## The Solution

By deploying CNDLive encoders in every room, the university created a unified video ecosystem.

### Workflow

1.  **Input**: The professor's laptop (HDMI) and the room camera (SDI) feed into a single encoder.
2.  **Processing**: The encoder creates a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) layout.
3.  **Delivery**: The stream is sent via NDI to the Zoom Room PC and simultaneously recorded to a NAS server.
