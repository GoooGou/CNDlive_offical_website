**Shenzhen, China, Sep. 6, 2024—** CNDLive, a provider of innovative video streaming solutions, announced the launch of its latest product, the CNDLive Manager, a comprehensive platform designed to centralize the management of devices and network streams. This powerful tool enables users to remotely configure device settings, execute device functions, perform firmware upgrades in bulk, and even preview the current encoding or decoding video of all CNDLive products.

## Distinctive features:

1. **Aggregated Connectivity**: Devices with two or more network connections connected to the CNDLive Manager will benefit from aggregated connectivity, with the system automatically adjusting the proportion of data transmitted through each connection based on proprietary algorithms developed by CNDLive.
2. **Server Streaming**: All CNDLive encoders connected to the CNDLive Manager will generate unlimited streams using various protocols such as SRT, RTMP, RTMPS, HLS, UDP, and RTSP.
3. **Stream Matrix**: Users can visually connect server push streams to any destination (e.g., decoders, YouTube, vMix, etc.) via a graphical interface, allowing them to add additional sources and destinations while the server converts the source stream into the desired protocol before pushing it to the final location.

“The CNDLive Manager represents a significant step forward in the evolution of video streaming technology,” said Harry, CEO of CNDLive. “We’re thrilled to offer our customers a solution that simplifies the management of their devices and streams, making it easier than ever to deliver high-quality content across multiple platforms.”

The CNDLive Manager is now available for use with all CNDLive products, providing unparalleled flexibility and control for content creators and distributors. For more information, please visit \[[www.CNDLive.com](http://www.cndlive.com/)\].
