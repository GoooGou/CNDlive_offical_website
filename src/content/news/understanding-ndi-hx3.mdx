## What is NDI|HX3?

NDI (Network Device Interface) has revolutionized local video production. The latest iteration, **NDI|HX3**, offers a perfect middle ground between the high-bandwidth Full NDI and the highly compressed NDI|HX2.

### Key Advantages

1.  **Visually Lossless Quality**: NDI|HX3 delivers video quality that is almost indistinguishable from uncompressed sources.
2.  **Ultra-Low Latency**: Unlike RTMP or HLS, NDI|HX3 operates with sub-100ms latency, making it ideal for IMAG (Image Magnification) in live venues.
3.  **Bandwidth Efficiency**: It uses significantly less bandwidth than Full NDI, allowing you to run multiple 4K streams on a standard Gigabit network.

## How CNDLive Supports NDI

All our latest C-Series encoders, including the newly released C6, come with native NDI|HX3 support. This means you can integrate our hardware directly into vMix, OBS, or TriCaster workflows without capturing cards.

> NDI|HX3 is the future of flexible, IP-based video production.
