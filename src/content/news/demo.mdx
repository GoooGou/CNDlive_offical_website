## 1. Typography Check

This is a standard paragraph to test the body text color. It should be **dark grey/black** in Light Mode and **light grey/white** in Dark Mode. The contrast should be high enough to read comfortably.

### H3 Heading Test

This is a subsection. Below is a test of **bold text** and _italic text_. We also need to check if [Links to Google](https://google.com) are displayed in your brand color (Red) and have the correct hover effect.

## 2. Custom Components (Callout)

This is the most important test. We are using the `not-prose` class in these components to ensure they ignore the global typography styles.

<Callout type="info" title="Information">
  This is an **Info** callout. In Light Mode, the background should be White,
  and this text should be **Pure Black**. In Dark Mode, the background should be
  Black/Dark Grey, and this text should be White.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Warning Note">
  **Warning:** Do not use unmanaged switches for NDI workflows. Check if the
  icon is Amber/Orange and the text is clearly visible.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success" title="Success!">
  Great job! The styling pipeline is working correctly. * List item inside
  callout * Another item
</Callout>
